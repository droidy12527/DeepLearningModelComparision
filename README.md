# Research: CNN Model Comparision For ANPR (Indian Numberplates).
### Includes Models like VGG, MobileNetV2 and Le-Net for Classification of Numberplate Digits using Data Augmentation
## Research Include.
- Comparing The accuracy Between different Deep Learning Model for ANPR.
- Comparing The efficiency of models and time taken by them for processing the inputs.
- The Trainable Params needed by them and total training time required to run on a machine.
- Computer vision Image Blur issue and how a model tackle it.
- Confusion between digits like 0 and O also letters like 1 and I.
- Plotting the heatmap of Matrix to see the disturbances and false positives.
- The number of Epochs required for Each model.
## Results of Different Models
1. Le-Net Model for Different Indian Numberplate Alphabets.
